## Workshops

### previsit-questionnaire-app

I am currently working on a multi-tenant SaaS application for pre-visit questionnaires with EHR mappings. The project is designed to be a modular monolith, built with Nestjs and Nextjs, and includes authentication and authorization using Keycloak. It also supports caching with Redis.
The system design is included in the repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/akojimsg/previsit-questionnaire-app/blob/main/architecture_diagram.png).


### Spring Microservices Workshop

In this workshop, I guide participants through the process of building a microservices architecture using Spring Boot. The workshop covers essential topics such as service discovery, API gateway, and inter-service communication. Participants will gain hands-on experience in creating and deploying microservices using Spring Cloud and Docker.

Will be build an e-commerce application with the following microservices:

- User Service
- Product Service
- Order Service
- Analytics Service
- Notification Service

The workshop repository can be found [here](https://github.com/akojimsg/springboot-microservice-workshop)


## Trainings

This section contains trainings I am currently working on or have completed. The trainings are designed to enhance my skills and knowledge in various areas of software development, particularly in the Java ecosystem and microservices architecture.

### Spring I/O
In this training, I am learning about the latest features and best practices in Spring Framework. The focus is on building scalable and maintainable applications using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. The training includes hands-on exercises and real-world examples to reinforce the concepts learned.

### Mastering microservices with Java

In this training, I am diving deep into the principles and practices of microservices architecture. The focus is on building resilient and scalable microservices using Java and Spring Boot. The training covers topics such as service discovery, API gateway, inter-service communication, and monitoring.

This is derived from the [Mastering microservices with Java](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781789530728) book by Sourabh Sharma. The training includes hands-on exercises and real-world examples to reinforce the concepts learned.
